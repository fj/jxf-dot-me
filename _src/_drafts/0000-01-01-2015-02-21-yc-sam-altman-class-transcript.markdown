On February 21st, 2015 at 21:00 UTC, Sam Altman gave a  [a class](https://courses.platzi.com/classes/startup-class/live/) on [Platzi](https://courses.platzi.com/), a platform for distributed learning.

What follows a summary transcript for deaf or hard-of-hearing folks (or for people who just don't want to watch the whole video).

* **18:55.** Freddy Vega ([@freddier](https://twitter.com/freddier)), the Platzi co-founder implores everyone to stay patient while they work through some technical issues with the microphone.

* **19:02.** A thumping electronica rendition of Ludacris's "Move Bitch (Get Out the Way)".

* **19:06.** Sam Altman is live.

* "The right way to get started is not to form a company; once you form a company, there's too much pressure."

* "AirBNB started with a completely outlandish idea: sleep on my air mattress for rent! But it worked. And there are countless more stories like this. Ideas that sound plausible are not what make great startups. The best way to make an idea work is to start a project, not a company."

* "Technical cofounders are essential for being a great company. At least one company on the team needs to be able to build what the company is making. Need someone to help evaluate the other technical people."

* "What you want: fast-growing market that's going to be huge in 10 years, not a slow-growing market that's already big. One advantage that young people have: Young people are more willing to make a bet on something that looks small but is actually going to be big." Sam calls these ideas _secret ideas_.

* "Make something people want. Startups that do this can do almost everything else wrong and still be good."


* Be decisive. "One of the way we evaluate how good YC founders are is how much they're executing and how long it takes them to make decisions. Good startups are doing something new every week."

* Be formidable. "It's important to become tough, to become formidable. This is something you can get better at."

* Get users. "Getting a big press launch and having TechCrunch launch. Every founder believes that they're going to be different and that it's going to work for them. Get users manually. Until you get these users, you're just guessing about what they want. You need to keep responding to feedback until you b"

* It's better to build something that a small number of users _love_, rather than something that a large number of users _like_.

* Be honest with yourself about whether you've really built something that users love.

* Burn rate: How much money you lose every month. High burn rates sometimes work, but usually kill startups. Founders usually deceive themselves about how things are going in this respect.

* The best founders can articulate their strategy in just a few sentences, and it's never complex. It's

* Learn to ask for what you want.

* A common mistake founders make: assuming that what the press says about you is a metric of your company. Ignore everything the press says and focus on how the company is actually doing.

* Generate revenue early in the life in the company. It's critical to do this in small doses early. You don't need to optimize for revenue, but you do need to coming.

## Part 2

* Hiring: Don't do it. Hold off as long as you can. But when you do need to do it, spend a lot of time on hiring.

* Equity: Give a lot of equity. The first few employees of the business should get a significant amount of equity. {{How to hire link from}}

* Fire people quickly when you get it wrong.

* Don't work with people you don't have a good feeling about. "I didn't trust my instincts and got burned by it. It took me a while to learn that no matter how good someone seems on paper, if they didn't feel good, don't work with them."

* Scaling. "There are probably only five or six ways to acquire users at scale, but one of the best ways is word of mouth."

* Growth rate. The best startups know what their growth rate is. Growth is the life of a startup. "Growth solves all problems."

* What do you do when growth stops and when things aren't working? Most founders give inspirational speech to the troops. Employees don't want to hear that. Instead, focus on small, tactical wins.

* "The best companies are missionaries, not mercenaries. You want a culture of missionaries to develop, where people believe in the mission of the company. If the startup is working on something is important but it encounters difficulty, people will work far harder than money would ever convince them to do. The company needs to evolve to become a mission that everyone, but especially the founders, are exceptionally dedicated to."

* Focus on 2-3 things a day, make sure they get done.

* Excuses. Lots of things go wrong when you're a founder. One important deal to make with yourself is that the buck should stop with you -- don't make excuses. If something bad happens, it's on you.

* At some point, you will transition from being responsible for a product to being responsible for a company.

* Learning to manage people.
