I allocate some time for mentoring and answering questions every week, because I think it's an important way to grow the software community and help novices, and because we were all there once. Despite the very different audiences served by the online and meatspace locations where I spend my mentoring time, I find that the same questions keep coming up from beginning developers.

I'm using this page as an attempt to codify and expand on some of those questions, and to provide a resource for 

# Learning software development

> I want to be a better developer. What should I focus on learning?

Broadly speaking, five things are of importance no matter what programming language you're using:

* arrays
* data structures
* algorithms
* empathy
* collaboration

*Arrays* are a fundamental building block of software development, required for almost any non-trivial program. They occupy such an important place because many languages provide arrays as a primitive data type, and because more complex data structures can be built using only arrays and references. By combining these two kinds of objects in different ways, an entire zoo of data structures emerges.

*Data structures* are
