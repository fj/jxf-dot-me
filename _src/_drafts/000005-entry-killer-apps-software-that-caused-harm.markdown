  When good software goes bad.
---

We often think of software as providing a benefit, either to us personally or to society at large -- or at least, a benefit in excess of its cost. The costs and consequences are many and often ill-considered, especially when software turns out to have bugs. Sometimes this is merely a frustrating inconvenience: you lose a presentation you were working on and have to start over, for example. Other times, software failures are more serious: a bug in a weather prediction model might miss a thunderstorm or blizzard and endanger lives.

But far worse, and too numerous, are the true horror stories: cases where software didn't merely endanger lives, but directly harm-ed or killed people. Each one provides a harsh reminder for developers and engineers to remember the lessons of history -- to remember the humans at the other end of the software, and the consequences when things go wrong.
