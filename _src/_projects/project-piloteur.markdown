Researchers interested in improving the energy efficiency of homes face a daunting challenge: getting data about real homes requires putting expensive sensor platforms into uncontrolled, hostile environments. Pets, power outages, and children often signal the death knell for getting reliable data from your sensor network in each home until a technician is sent out to fix things -- a time-consuming and costly process.

Wouldn't things be easier if those sensor networks could diagnose themselves, be self-healing, and remotely update, all without human intervention? And wouldn't research be simpler if those networks reported their own data, rather than waiting for a research technician to come out and collect the data? Now they can! Welcome to the future.

With the invaluable and inimitable [Filippo Valsorda](https://twitter.com/filosottile) and under the auspices of [Dr. Kamin Whitehouse](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~whitehouse/), I built Piloteur, a deployment platform for reliable smart-home sensor networks. Piloteur can be instantly and rapidly deployed using nothing but your AWS key and a deployment target -- that's all you need to start a network. I also [co-authored a paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2674076) about the work which appears in Proceedings of the 1st ACM Conference On Embedded Systems For Energy-Efficient Building (BuildSys 2014); the result was so successful that it won Best Presentation at BuildSys 2014. There's also a GitHub repository that you can access [here](https://github.com/piloteur/piloteur).
