Charlottesville is very gradually emerging as a regional technology hub in Virginia and more generally in the mid-Atlantic. [HackCville](http://hackcville.com), a clubhouse for student entrepreneurs, is great evidence that a solid ecosystem for startups is beginning to form.

HackCville fills a much-needed void between the University's earnest and commendable but somewhat fragmented efforts to cultivate entrepreneurship, and just blindly striking out towards a business with no experience whatsoever. (Sometimes blindly striking out is a fantastic idea, but if you can articulate neither where you want to go nor where you want to wind up that's almost always a problem.) It has been wildly successful and has readily emerged as a beacon to students who want experience but aren't sure where to get it, or how to do it in a structured environment.

During my volunteer office hours at HackCville, I mentor students from all walks of life and experience -- each from completely different ages, backgrounds, and goals. My job was to help them explore entrepreneurship and be better at business-making, and to help them avoid the mistakes of my own past and those of others. By far, the most successful mentees all had one attribute in common -- English doesn't have a great word for the exact quality I'm thinking of, but it is a mix of _resolve_, _empathy_, and _ambition_. I'm sure I'll be seeing them all in the newspaper someday!
