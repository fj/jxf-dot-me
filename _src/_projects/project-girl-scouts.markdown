In 2006, Girl Scouts of America (GSA) underwent a series of major structural reorganizations designed to reduce its overhead as a large national organization. But one very important change also happened that had nothing to do with corporate restructuring: the removal of trans fats from all Girl Scout Cookie recipes.

As any baker will tell you, fats are crucial for baking. Solid fats are required for the texture of many baked goods, like pie crusts or cookies -- without solid fats, you wind up with crunchy, crispy baked goods instead of moist, chewy ones. Fats are also critical for the Maillaird reactions, a series of chemical processes that brown foods and give them a richer flavor profile. But when medical research revealed that the most popular kind of solid fats, trans fats, were highly correlated with coronary artery disease, GSA sprang into action and asked its bakeries to revise their recipes to eliminate all trans fats. This was a tall order.

The bakeries experimented with a number of recipes and tried taste tests with many focus groups. Little Brownie Bakers, a division of the [Keebler Company](https://www.keebler.com/), took a particularly methodological approach to the focus-group research and asked me to help them find the best cookie recipes among the bunch. Taste is only one part of the equation in the bakery business, so "best" is not a straightforward determination: other considerations include things like shelf stability (how well the ingredients stand up over time), resilience (how well the product resists the wear and tear of shipping), and many other factors.

I was asked to consult on helping to analyze the resulting consumer data from the focus groups, in order to identify which recipes were the best according to a number of systematic criteria. I built a Python web application to let the food testers track and upload data from the focus groups, project estimated costs and production capacity for each recipe, and ultimately produce the best Girl Scout cookie money can buy. It worked: 2007 was a record year for Girl Scout cookies, [generating almost a billion dollars in sales](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/01/business/01sbiz.html?pagewanted=all), and the trans fats were gone.
