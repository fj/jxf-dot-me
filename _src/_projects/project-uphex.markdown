[UpHex](http://uphex.com) is a business I'm really proud of. My cofounder, [Bradley](https://twitter.com/justthekipp), was formerly the CFO of another company I consulted for, which is how we met. We started UpHex because we were convinced that businesses deserve better than to have the mountains of analytics data they collect relegated to the corporate IT dustbin.

The central premise of UpHex is that web-based businesses collect a lot of implicit metrics data via services like Google Analytics, Facebook, Shopify, and so on, but use very little of it. They are therefore leaving money and information on the table. Most of the time, this failure mode happens because businesses simply don't have the time or technical expertise to dissect reams of analytics data. That's where UpHex comes in: in exchange for a monthly subscription fee, your company authorizes UpHex to connect to the data streams currently gathering dust, and we'll analyze and process them for you in real time.

When we detect that something's happening that we think you should pay attention to, we'll notify you so you can elect whether to take immediate action -- an opportunity that would otherwise have been lost forever. If you're not sure what to do (e.g., your web traffic is unexpectedly spiking) UpHex can provide some automated suggestions for actions you can take (e.g., showing you the top recent referrers to identify the new traffic source), or you can engage with an analytics counselor to get a pair of human eyes on your issue with a single click. The number of missed opportunities to improve businesses that are lost each day is truly staggering.

I don't have a formal title other than cofounder, since UpHex isn't really big enough to stand on ceremony. But I act as the de facto CTO -- hiring and managing our engineering talent, setting the technical direction for the company, and making the big architectural choices that I think set us up for success. Most importantly, I get my hands dirty on a day-to-day basis, and I absolutely love it. As of 2015, UpHex has processed millions of data points, from thousands of different metrics, from hundreds of businesses.
