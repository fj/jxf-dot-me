The MEDRAD Stellant D is a [computed tomography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_computed_tomography) (CT) injection system, a device used for imaging human tissue to diagnose medical conditions. Imaging happens by passing radiation through a patient; the selective absorption of the radiation by different tissues creates a picture that a physician can use to determine if tumors or other medical problems are present.

Because radiation is generally harmful to living things, minimizing the amount of radioactive exposure patients receive is important, so <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiocontrast_agent">a special dye</a> is also injected that increases the clarity and contrast of the images that are resolved. The software in the injector computes the correct timing and optimal dose of the dye to minimize the radioactive exposure that patients are subjected to.

I was retained to revamp the team's internal software testing procedures for the new Stellant D product line, construct a suitable test platform for the system, and perform a code review and audit of the existing procedures. Today, the Stellant system is one of the most popular injection systems in use, and has provided care for tens of thousands of patients. Bayer HealthCare's revenue has more than doubled in the last ten years, to US$20 billion in 2014.
