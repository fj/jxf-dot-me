Cardagin Networks is a startup formed with the mission of making it easier for small businesses to own and operate their own loyalty programs. Traditionally, small businesses interested in loyalty programs don't have a lot of spare time or effort to devote to these platforms.

I was hired as the company's first CTO after a rocky initial launch, and given carte blanche to initiate a business and technology turnaround. We went from zero to eight technical team members in twelve weeks and built a website, two mobile applications, and an administrative platform for the business customers. At the same time, we built a sales team and the technology infrastructure necessary to support their rollout and equip them for success.

Six months later, thanks to much better revenue numbers and the revamped platform, Cardagin raised US$5.25 million and was on the [front page of TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/18/cardagin-networks-grabs-4-25-million-for-mobile-loyalty-platform/). After pulling that off, with the major technical challenges behind us and the company on a stable technology trajectory, I stepped down and turned things over to the executive team; Cardagin was eventually sold in 2013.
