  Hope isn't necessarily lost if you've accidentally deleted a file.

Even the best developers will have a war story in which they accidentally deleted an important file. Or in especially unlucky cases, [an entire production database](https://github.com/blog/744-today-s-outage).

If this happens to you, the first course of action is not to panic. One

Did you accidentally deleted

Deleted a file with `rm`{:.shell}, or even with

```
$ really-bad-delete
oh noes!
```
{:.shell}

But this isn't:

```ruby
def ayy(lmao)
end
```

Wow
