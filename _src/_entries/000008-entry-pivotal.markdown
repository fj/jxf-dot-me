  I'm joining a field engineering team at Pivotal.

I love what I've done at [UpHex](http://uphex.com) and the work we're doing to make analytics monitoring easy for businesses everywhere. However, for a while now I've felt a little bit of tension about the range of topics I like talking and speaking about, and my day-to-day work. I have a lot of curiosity itches to scratch, and I've never been able to satisfy them by doing just one thing.

As luck would have it, I was recently approached by [Pivotal](https://pivotal.io), the builders of [Spring]. But most importantly, they're a founding member of the Open Computing Foundation. They asked if I would consider becoming an Advisory Field Engineer.

Effective August 1, 2015, I've accepted an offer to be an Advisory Field Engineer to Pivotal's Financial Services group. Of course, I'll continue to be a principal in UpHex with my wonderful cofounder [Bradley Kipp](https://twitter.com/justthekipp).
