I'm presenting **Continuous Everything** at [Automacon 2015](www.automacon.io) from September 15-17 in Portland, Oregon. It will be a 20-minute recorded talk.

### Abstract

Over the past twenty years, we've seen many organizations move along the continuum of "continuous": continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment, and most recently, continuous provisioning.

But why stop there? What happens when we keep pulling out manual steps and replacing them with automated, continuous ones, with the ultimate goal of making deployment a completely disposable, completely isolated, and completely automated task? In this talk, I'll argue that we shouldn't be satisfied with the status quo, and that our work has only just begun. We'll explore exactly what we need to make this goal happen, and why it has enormous benefits for your organization, your deployments, and your sanity.
