  Presenting **Distributed Consensus**, a 30-minute talk.

I'm presenting **Distributed Consensus** at [beCamp 2015](http://becamp.org/) on October 24th, 2015 in Charlottesville, VA. It will be a 30-minute talk followed by Q&A.

We'll cover:

* what it means for computers to agree on things (that is, _consensus_)
* why consensus is harder when computers aren't right next to each other (that is, _distributed_)
* how to get computers to agree on things
* why it's hard for computers to agree on things (many surprising failure modes)
* one way of getting computers to agree on things, the Raft consensus algorithm
