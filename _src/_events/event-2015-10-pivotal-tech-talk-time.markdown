  Presenting **A Matter of Time**, a 30-minute talk.
---

I'm presenting **A Matter of Time** at [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotal.io/) in New York City, NY. It will be a 30-minute talk followed by Q&A.

### Abstract

Did you know that every so often, a minute lasts 61 seconds? Or that a leap year doesn't happen every 4 years? Or that sometimes, October 5th doesn't come after October 4th? If that sounds like something that might break some software, you'd be right!

In this talk, we'll discuss the common ways that time is implemented in a number of libraries you probably depend on, how these representations can fall short of giving us a complete picture of what time it is, and what we can do about this state of affairs.
